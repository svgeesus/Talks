hobbit story - constant near failure, but eventual sucess and return home. even though problems lurk.

1) VRML first, as quick.
vrml, problem was
- lack of hardware at affordable, widely deployed scale
- lack of essential features for model interaction, spatial sound, social interaction

in vrml story, as well as aframe also add webgpu

2) WebFonts next *mostly needs history slides*
*a few slides from font level up are usable*

print workshop

@font face but two different authoring tools, two different platforms
general failure
use notes, dates, from @font-face src explainer

*needs slides*
disparate communities - atypi chiselling, last typographers of a generation, web will eat our livelihood.
network engineers, font people just want DRM! layout is not hard, put the characters on the line til you reach the end

demystifying, explaining, understanding enough of the other side not to demonise
(can be the same, designers and back-end developers)

then building on reliable webfonts (*existing slides*)
- font features
- variable fonts
- chromatic fonts

fonts, problem was
- lack of trust, respect between technical communities
- licensing, web is not print, failure to see as opportunity not threat
- failure to agree on a distribution format
- could not use typographic features until fonts reliably provided

WOFF, WOFF2, adoption graph

Mention font usage in Asia, still too big, working on it.

3) the color story (from 25 years of pain)

*slides mostly okay. largest part of the talk*

- missing the impact of mobile
- democratization of WCG screens
- catching up to WCG (brwsers) vs impatient for HDR (media)
- doing stuff with it (mix, contrast, api)
* mention workshop

probably drop the wasm sub story, no time, not much to say

summary
pull together the lessons
- find out what is really in the way
- learn to listen
    even if you don't like what you hear
- don't give up!
